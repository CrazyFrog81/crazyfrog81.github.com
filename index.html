                    <em>Prospective students</em>: Please take a look at my research profile and interests, and write a concrete research plan accordingly.
                    I will not respond to your email if the content is generic in any research area, for example, "I would like to do research in data visualization" or "in deep learning."
                    I do have a wide spectrum of research interests, but that does not mean that I am dedicated to or capable of doing any research.
                    It is fine if you know nothing about my research, in case that you are willing to and be able to do the research assigned to you!
