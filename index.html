            I'm an assistant professor in <a href="https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/">Computational Media and Arts (CMA)</a> Thrust, and jointly appointed in <a href="https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/information-hub/data-science-and-analytics">Data Science and Analytics (DSA)</a> Thrust
            of <a href="https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/information-hub">Information Hub</a>, <a href="https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/">the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</a>.
            I'm currently also affiliated with Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST(CWB).
            My research focuses on data visualization, visual analytics, VR/AR, and deep learning.
            Before joining HKUST, I worked as an associate researcher at <a href="https://siat.cas.cn/">Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>,
            and a senior researcher and CIVAL coordinator at <a href="https://fcl.ethz.ch/">Future Cities Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>.
            I received both the bachelor and Ph.D. degree in computer sciences from the <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx">Nanyang Technological University</a>.<br/>
            <br>
         I'm leading the Collaborative Interactive Visualization & Analysis Laboratory (CIVAL) @ HKUST (GZ). Find more information about CIVAL <a href="http://www.hkust-cival.com">here</a>.

                <LI>
                    I'm actively looking for PostDocs, PhDs, masters, and RAs.
                    Drop an email with your resume and research plan if you are <B>hardworking, creative, and well-motivated for high-quality research!</B>

                    <em>Prospective students</em>: Please take a look at my research profile and interests, and write a concrete research plan accordingly.
                    I will not respond to your email if the content is generic in any research area, for example, "I would like to do research in data visualization" or "in deep learning."
                    I do have a wide spectrum of research interests, but that does not mean that I am dedicated to or capable of doing any research.
                    It is fine if you know nothing about my research, in case that you are willing to and be able to do the research assigned to you!
